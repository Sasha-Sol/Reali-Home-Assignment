Home Assignment Instruction

If I had more time for this assignment I would chose NoSQL database like MongoDB because the data looks 
like it can be changed at some point and its harder to maintain a lot of changes in data structure when using sql database.

To run this code on your local machine you need to:
1.	create a schema in mysql database with name = realidb
2.	create ‘apartment’ table 
3.	go to application.properties and change the user and password fields to yours
I changed the urls to http://localhost:8080/reali-api/listings and http://localhost:8080/reali-api/start

BONUS 
The url for the bonus exercise is  http://localhost:8080/reali-api/listings/bonus and its POST request
Example request

{
    "status":["active"],
    "page":0,
    "pageSize":10,
    "priceFrom":100000,
    "priceTo":1231333,
    "bedroomsFrom":1,
    "bedroomsTo":6,
    "bathroomsFrom":1,
    "bathroomsTo":10
}
